# Page data

Vite-pages is a React app framework that collect your pages data and pass them to your theme. So what kinds of data does it collect?

Each page consists of two kinds of data:

- Static data
- Runtime data

## Static data

For `.tsx|.jsx` pages, you can define static data with **a docblock(comment) at the top of the file**.

```tsx
/**
 * @title index page
 * @tags tag1,tag2
 */
```

This will be collected as:

```json
{ "title": "index page", "tags": "tag1,tag2" }
```

For `.md|.mdx` pages, you can define static data with YAML front matter:

```md
---
title: my page
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---
```

This will be collected as:

```json
{ "title": "my page", "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"] }
```

> As you can see, YAML front matter can express some simple data structure(.e.g array), while a docblock's properties can only express strings. A qualified theme should understand both of these static data.

## Runtime data

Runtime page data is just anything you export from a page file.

## Difference

Both static data and runtime data will be passed to the theme, so the theme can use them to render the view.

Difference:

- Static data of **all pages** is loaded **eagerly** when the app bootstrap. So you should try to keep the static data small.
- Runtime data is only loaded when user navigate to that page.
- The value type of static data is limited (string or simple object/array), while the value of runtime data can be any javascript value (.e.g a React component).

## How theme consume these data

As stated in <Link to="/theme-customization">the theme customization doc</Link>, a theme is a React compoent. It will be rendered by vite-pages core, and get useful info from props:

- All pages' static data
- All runtime data that is already loaded
- The current loading state of the app

Here is the type of a theme:

import ThemeInterface from './theme-interface.mdx'

<ThemeInterface />

> Here is an example vite-pages theme implementation: [vite-pages-theme-basic](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/blob/master/packages/theme-basic/src/index.tsx). [This fixture](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/blob/master/fixtures/use-theme/pages/_theme.tsx) demonstrate how to use it.

## Vite-pages core doesn't care what your page data looks like

Vite-pages itself doesn't care what the page data looks like. How to interpret the page data and render the view, is totally decided by <Link to="/theme-customization">the theme</Link>. Vite-pages just collect your pages data and pass them to the theme. This design make the vite-pages core more "simple" and make themes more powerful.

Most themes ask users to `export default` a React component from page files(.e.g <Link to="/basic-theme">the basic theme</Link>). But that is not a requirement from vite-pages core.

If you are a theme user, you should read the doc of your theme to learn what data should be exported from your pages.
