# Page data

Vite-pages is a React app framework that collect your pages data and pass them to your theme. So what kinds of data does it collect?

Each page consists of two kinds of data:

- Static data
- Runtime data

## Static data

For `.tsx|.jsx` pages, you can define static data with **comment at the top of the file**.

```tsx
/**
 * @title index page
 * @tags tag1,tag2
 */
```

This will be collected as:

```json
{ "title": "index page", "tags": "tag1,tag2" }
```

For `.md|.mdx` pages, you can define static data with YAML front matter:

```md
---
title: my page
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---
```

This will be collected as:

```json
{ "title": "my page", "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"] }
```

## Runtime data

Runtime page data is just anything you export from a page file.

## Difference

Both static data and runtime data will be passed to the theme, so the theme can use them to render the view.

Difference:

- Static data of **all pages** is loaded eagerly when the app bootstrap. So you should try to keep the static data small.
- Runtime data is only loaded when user navigate to that page.
- The value type of static data is limited (string or simple object/array), while the value of runtime data can be any javascript value (.e.g a React component).

## How theme consume these data

As stated in <Link to="/theme">the theme doc</Link>, a theme contains these **render functions**:

import ThemeInterface from './theme-interface.mdx'

<ThemeInterface />

When the init function is called, the `IPages` provides the **static data of all pages**:

```ts
interface IPages {
  [path: string]: {
    staticData: any
  }
}
```

When the page is loading, only static data is available.

When the page is loaded, the `IPageLoaded` contains both static data and runtime data:

```ts
{
  ...pageStaticData, // static data of current page
  ...pageRuntimeData, // runtime data of current page
  _path: '/page/path',
}
```

## Vite-pages core doesn't care about your page data

Vite-pages itself doesn't care what the page data looks like. How to interpret the page data, is totally decided by <Link to="/theme">your theme</Link>. This design make the vite-pages core more "simple" and make themes more powerful.

Most themes ask users to `export default` a React component from page files. But that is not a requirement from vite-pages core.

If you are a theme user, you should read the doc of your theme to learn what data should be exported from your pages.

> Here is an example vite-pages theme implementation: [vite-pages-theme-basic](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/blob/master/packages/theme-basic/src/index.tsx). [This fixture](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/blob/master/fixtures/use-theme/pages/_theme.tsx) demonstrate how to use it.
